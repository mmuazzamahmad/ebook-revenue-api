# üìà Amazon Kindle eBook Sales Revenue Predictor API

An end-to-end machine learning application engineered to serve real-time predictions for the sales revenue of eBooks on Amazon Kindle. This project features a powerful XGBoost model, a robust REST API built with FastAPI, and a complete CI/CD pipeline for automated cloud deployment.

## üöÄ Live API Documentation

The API is live and publicly accessible. You can interact with it directly through the auto-generated FastAPI documentation.

**Live API Docs: [https://ebook-revenue-api.onrender.com/docs](https://ebook-revenue-api.onrender.com/docs)**
*(Note: The Render service may spin down on inactivity and take 30-60 seconds to restart on the first request.)*

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

This project follows a modern MLOps architecture, separating the concerns of model training and API inference.

1.  **Model Training**: The `train_model.py` script loads the dataset, preprocesses the features, and trains the XGBoost regression model. The trained model is then serialized and saved as `model/model.pkl`.
2.  **API Service**: The FastAPI application (`main.py`) loads the pre-trained model at startup. It defines a `/predict` endpoint that accepts eBook features as a JSON payload.
3.  **Containerization**: The `Dockerfile` creates a lightweight, portable image containing the FastAPI application, the trained model, and all necessary dependencies.
4.  **Deployment**: The application is deployed on **Render**. A GitHub Action is configured to automatically trigger a new build and deployment on Render whenever a push is made to the `main` branch.
